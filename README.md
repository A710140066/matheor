# Matheor
> Educational math game made in Unity/C#

Conveying to children that math can be fun is the main purpose of this video game.
The core gameplay - combining aliens (numbers) with artifacts (operators) to defeat the boss - does just that. 
Made with love by satraul, rayzaarasj and muzakkiha.
